# c4

Where the c4 remote administration tool is being built!

The c4 RAT is a remote administration tool totally written in python.
It works via the upload of the received data to a ftp server.
The code is quite simple and it is not definitely finished yet; you can propose suggestions if you want!

Hope you like it! :)
