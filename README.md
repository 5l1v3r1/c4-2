# c4

Where the c4 remote administration tool, c4_RAT, is being built!

The c4_RAT is a remote administration tool, for computers running Windows, only, totally written in python.
It works via the upload of the received data to a ftp server.
The code is quite simple and it is not definitely finished yet; you can propose suggestions if you want!

Hope you like it! :)

Some technical issues: 
Make sure:
- Your python path is C:\Python27;
- Your pyinstaller path is C:\Python27\PyInstaller-2.1, even if you are not using this version;
- You are running the program as an administrator;
- You've got all the modules required on your computer;
- You are using it with the AUTHORIZATION and the AWARENESS of the computer's owner;
- You are specifying all the paths, can be done with --paths=, while compiling the code with pyinstaller.
