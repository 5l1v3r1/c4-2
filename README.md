# c4

Where the c4 remote administration tool, c4_RAT, is being built!

The c4_RAT is a remote administration tool, for computers running Windows, only, totally written in python.

You can now make sure that nobody is using your computer while you are away!

It works via the upload of received data to a ftp server.

The code is quite simple and it is not definitely finished, yet; you can propose suggestions if you want!

Hope you like it! :)

Some technical issues: 

Make sure:

- Your python path is C:\Python27;
- Your pyinstaller path is C:\Python27\PyInstaller-2.1, even if you are not using this version;
- You are running the program as an administrator;
- You've got all the required modules on your computer;
- You are using it with the AUTHORIZATION and the AWARENESS of the computer's owner;
- You are specifying all the paths, can be done with --paths=, while compiling the code with pyinstaller.
